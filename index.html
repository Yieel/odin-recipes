        <p>Take mindfulness, creativity and a dash of focus. Fold together gently,
            bake in a slow oven and watch your spirits rise. Yes, your time spent in
            the kitchen can enhance your mood and promote mental wellbeing. While cooking
            is clearly a means to satisfy the body’s need for food, it’s increasingly being recognised as a way of nurturing the mind.
            A study in the International Journal of Humanities and Social Science looked at 
            the therapeutic qualities of cooking as a hobby, including its reported ability to cause a dimmed sense of time and an
            altered sense of consciousness. The researchers found that the act of cooking improves a person’s wellbeing and is associated 
            with life satisfaction. Additionally, they discovered that cooking was the best predictor of subjective happiness. For some, 
            time spent in the kitchen engrossed in baking and cooking may be exactly the recipe needed for greater happiness and mental wellbeing.</p>
